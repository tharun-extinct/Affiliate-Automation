## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Telegram Bot Token
- A Telegram Channel/Group ID
- Amazon Affiliate Account

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd affiliate-automation
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=@your_channel_name
```

2. Set up your products list:
- Use `create_excel.py` to create initial `products.xlsx`
- Or create your own Excel file with columns:
  - amazon_url
  - affiliate_link
  - posted

## File Structure

- `main.py` - Main application script
- `create_excel.py` - Helper script to create products Excel file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `products.xlsx` - Product database (not in repo)
- `.env` - Environment variables (not in repo)

## Usage

1. Add your products to `products.xlsx`:
   - `amazon_url`: Original Amazon product URL
   - `affiliate_link`: Your affiliate link for the product
   - `posted`: Leave as FALSE (will be auto-updated)

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
- Load products from Excel
- Scrape product details from Amazon
- Post to Telegram with 1-minute intervals
- Mark products as posted
- Check for new products every 5 minutes

## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Default 1-minute gap between posts

   - Logs errors for debugging
   - Continues operation on errors

3. **Data Management**:

- Error messages
- Status updates

## Security Notes
